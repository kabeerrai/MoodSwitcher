# 🎭 Mood Switcher

**Mood Switcher** is a fun and interactive web project where the user can select how they’re feeling by clicking one of the mood buttons:

😃 Happy | 😞 Sad | 😠 Angry | 😐 Neutral

Based on the selection, the background color and an encouraging message change to match the user's mood.

## 🧠 Pseudo Code / Plan

1. **Create an output field**  
   - A section or `div` to display mood-based messages.

2. **Create four buttons**  
   - Buttons for: 😃 Happy, 😞 Sad, 😠 Angry, 😐 Neutral.

3. **Style the elements**  
   - Apply CSS for layout, spacing, button design, and transitions.

4. **Access elements using the DOM**  
   - Use JavaScript to select the buttons, output field, and body.

5. **Handle mood selection with event listeners**  
   - Add `click` event listeners to each button.
   - Change the page background and message based on which button is pressed.
